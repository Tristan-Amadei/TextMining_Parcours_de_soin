The objective of the study is to clarify the causes of mortality in heart failure patients, who are increasingly older. Knowing the main causes of mortality in these patients and their most frequent
care pathways will have a major public health impact. <br />
To answer our question, we first characterize the care pathways of patients through the study of sequential patterns: using GHM codes (Groupes Homog√®nes de Malades) defining hospitalizations, it is possible to find similarities in the care pathways, associated with a diagnosis. <br />
Once these pathways are identified, a survival analysis will predict the survival trajectory afterfirst hospitalization.
